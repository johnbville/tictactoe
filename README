This program allows a user to play Tic Tac Toe against a computer opponent.

The computer opponent is not a perfect opponent, and will occasionally lose to a
human player. The computer's moves are governed by these rules:

1. If the center space is empty, choose the center space.
2. If the computer has two spaces in a row, choose the space that results in a win.
3. If the human has two spaces in a row, choose the space that blocks the human.
4. If none of these conditions are true, choose a random available space.
